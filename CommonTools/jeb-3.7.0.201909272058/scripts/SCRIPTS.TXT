> SCRIPTS

This directory contains scripts for JEB clients. It comes with a set of sample
scripts publicly available on our GitHub repository, here:
https://github.com/pnfsoftware/jeb2-samplecode/tree/master/scripts

The JEB UI desktop client allows Python script execution via the Jython
package. Scripts should not be confused with plugins, although they use
the same JEB API.

In order to run scripts, a Jython package is required. JEB packages bundle the
latest version of Jython (2.7). Users may choose to use this one or another one.

To use another version of Jython:
- Download a stand-alone Jython package from http://www.jython.org/downloads.html
  We recommend version 2.5 (fastest) or version 2.7 (latest)
- Drop the downloaded 'jython-standalone-???.jar' file in the scripts/
  sub-directory located in your JEB installation directory
- Make sure that the client property '.ScriptsFolder' refers to that directory.
  It is the case by default; use 'Edit/Options, Advanced...' to verify this.

How to use:
- Within the UI client: scripts can be executed via the 'File/Scripts/Execute...'
  menu command.
- On the command-line: full clients may execute scripts using command lines like:
  $ jeb_macos.sh -c --srv2 --script=<path> ...
  Refer to your start-up script (eg, jeb_wincon.bat) help page for more details.
- Scripts should not be used for heavy-lifting operations. They are meant to
  execute small tasks within a the context of a JEB client. 
- Note that current JEB scripts significantly differ from JEB1 scripts. Refer to
  JEB Developer Portal for tutorials and API documentation:
